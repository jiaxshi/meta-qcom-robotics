# Welcome to the Qualcomm Intelligent Robotics Product SDK (QIRP SDK)

The Qualcomm® Intelligent Robotics Product (QIRP) SDK is a collection of components that enable you to develop robotic features on Qualcomm platforms. This SDK is applicable to the Qualcomm Linux releases.

The QIRP SDK provides the following:
- Reference code in Robot Operating System (ROS) packages to develop robotic applications.
- E2E(end-to-end) scenario samples to evaluate robotic platforms.
- Integrated cross-compile toolchain, which includes common build tools, such as aarch64-oe-linux-gcc, make, cmake, and ROS core.
- Tools and scripts to speed up the development.
- Provide some basic ROS nodes to help you build your ros application, such as qrb_ros_camera, qrb_ros_nn_inference,etc.

This will guide you through developing your first sample application. It explains how to:
- Flash the prebuilt Qualcomm linux image and configure the environment.
- Run sample applications.
- Develop sample applications using the prebuilt image and QIRP SDK.
- Generate customized images and QIRP SDK.
- Provides a Gazebo simulation environment for testing and debugging robotic applications.

This repository serves as a ​​layer in the QIRP SDK build system​​, working in conjunction with other layers such as:
- [meta-qcom-robotics-distro](https://github.com/qualcomm-linux/meta-qcom-robotics-distro.git) 
- [meta-qcom-robotics-sdk](https://github.com/qualcomm-linux/meta-qcom-robotics-sdk.git) 

to collectively build the **QIRP SDK**.
